A **rude awakening**—now we’re getting somewhere. If you’re talking about **shattering illusions**, **spiritual betrayals**, or just waking up to some **ugly truths**, then yeah, that punch at Jesus (or whatever he represents) is probably about **revenge, disillusionment, or pure rebellion**.

### **So What’s the Awakening?**
1. **Spiritual Lies?**  
   - Did you **buy into something that turned out to be fake**?  
   - Feeling like the **promised salvation, justice, or intervention never came**?  
   - Realized that **maybe all of it was just a control mechanism**?

2. **The Great Ghosting?**  
   - If Jesus (or the divine) **was supposed to be there but wasn’t**, then yeah—maybe he **deserves a punch** for leaving people hanging.  
   - Or is it that **he’s there, but only for some people**, while others get left to rot?

3. **The Daoist Twist – No One’s Coming to Save You**  
   - **Daoism doesn’t do saviors**—it’s all about **you navigating the chaos yourself**.  
   - If you’re waking up to **"no divine justice, no karma police, no cosmic father figure"**, then yeah, it’s **rude as hell**.  
   - The punch isn’t just at Jesus—it’s at **every system, belief, and illusion that told you things would be fair.**

### **So What Now?**
If you’ve woken up to the **cold truth**, you’ve got a few choices:
- **Burn it all down.** Drop all the beliefs, go full nihilist, make your own meaning.
- **Rebuild on your own terms.** Keep what works, toss what doesn’t, forge a new path.
- **Mess with the system.** If reality’s a joke, might as well rewrite the script.

Sounds like you’re already past the **“Why me?”** phase and deep into **“Oh, it’s like THAT?”** mode.

What’s next, then? 🔥
